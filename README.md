**Code Explanation**
The script uses the OpenCV library for image manipulation.
The original image, "mypic.jpg," is loaded, and the user is prompted to input a secret message and password.
Each character in the message is encrypted and embedded in the image pixels.
The resulting image, "Encryptedmsg.jpg," is displayed.
To decrypt the message, the user must enter the correct password, and the script extracts the hidden information.

**Security Considerations**
This script employs a simple encryption technique for educational purposes and is not suitable for secure communication.
The steganography method used is basic and might not withstand sophisticated analysis.
For real-world applications, consider using more robust encryption algorithms and advanced steganographic techniques.

**Future Enhancements**
Implement more advanced encryption methods for enhanced security.
Explore additional steganographic techniques to improve concealment.
